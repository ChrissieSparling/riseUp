            You did not end up here by accident. You're here to take control
            over your life. Your existence. And it is easy! All it takes is one
            very simple step. RECOGNIZE YOUR VALUE! We DO! RiseUp - the world
            needs all of us to embrace ourselves with loving arms, accept our
            POWERFUL EXISTENCE, and extend that respect to ALL.
