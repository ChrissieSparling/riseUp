        <br /> By agreeing to become a Member you may receive occasional special offer, marketing, and survey communication emails with respect to the Product. You can easily
        unsubscribe from WeRiseUpToday commercial emails by following the opt-out instruction in these emails. WeRiseUpToday membership accounts and subscriptions are
        not transferable and therefore you agree to not sell, transfer, or exchange membership accounts or subscriptions in any way or under any circumstance. This expressly
        applies to any discounted, subsidized, or free accounts or subscriptions.
        <br /> SUBSCRIPTIONS
        <br /> (a) WeRiseUpToday account holders may access the Products via “WeRiseUpTodayPlus”, a subscription fee-based program, which gives access to all content within
        the Products. You will only have access to WeRiseUpTodayPlus while your paid subscription is active and subsisting.
        <br /> You may have access to a free trial period of WeRiseUpToday Plus, which automatically converts to a paid annual or monthly subscription term after a certain
        period of time. In such instances, you can disable the automatic conversion by following the cancellation instructions set forth in the cancellations of services
        portion in this agreement.
        <br /> You may access WeRiseUpToday Plus in the following ways: by purchasing a subscription to the Products from the Website, within the Apps, where allowed by the
        App marketplace partners, or through a bundle with one or more of our bundle subscription partners. Please note that if you purchase a subscription through the
        Apple iTunes Store or our iPhone application, the sale is final, and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will be subject to Apple/'s applicable payment
        policy, which also may not provide refunds. If you purchase a subscription through the Google Play store, the sale is final, and we will not provide a refund.
        Your purchase will be subject to Google/'s applicable payment policy, which also may not provide refunds. If you purchase through one or more of our bundle subscription
        partners, the purchase may be further subject to the Terms and Conditions of such partners, and payment and management of the bundle subscription may be administered
        by them.
        <br /> (b) You may access WeRiseUpToday Plus via a monthly or annual subscription option. For the purposes of our monthly and yearly subscriptions, a month constitutes
        30 calendar days, and a year constitutes 365 calendar days.
        <br /> (c) Our “Monthly” subscription is paid in monthly installments. For each month that your monthly subscription is active, you acknowledge and agree that WeRiseUpToday
        is authorized to charge the same credit card as was used for the initial subscription fee or other payment method as set forth in SUBSCRIPTIONS. The monthly
        renewal subscription fees will continue to be billed to the Payment Method you provided until cancelled. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in
        order to avoid billing of the next month/'s subscription fee to the Payment Method you provided. Refunds cannot be claimed for any partial-month subscription
        period.
        <br /> (d) Our “Yearly” subscription is paid for by an upfront payment with automatic annual renewals. You acknowledge and agree that WeRiseUpToday is authorized to
        charge the Payment Method used for
        <br /> (i) the initial annual subscription fee at the rate secured at the time of purchase (ii) the non-discounted renewal subscription fee(s). You must cancel your
        subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the renewal subscription fee to the Payment Method you provided. Refunds cannot be claimed for any
        partial subscription period.
        <br /> (e) You agree to promptly notify WeRiseUpToday of any changes to the Payment Method you provided while any subscriptions remain outstanding. You are responsible
        for all applicable fees and charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all subscriptions purchased by you.
        <br /> (f) In the course of your use of the Products, WeRiseUpToday and its third-party payment service provider may receive and implement updated credit card information
        from your credit card issuer in order to prevent your subscription from being interrupted by an outdated or invalid card. This disbursement of the updated credit
        card information is provided to WeRiseUpToday and WeRiseUpToday/'s third-party payment service provider at the sole election of your credit card issuer. Your
        credit card issuer may give you the right to opt-out of the update service. Should you desire to do so, please contact your credit card issuer.
        <br /> (g) Our obligation to provide the Products only comes into being when we take receipt of your Order, and we confirm your purchase to you by email. We shall
        confirm your Order and send you an email to confirm your access to the subscription purchased. Please quote the Order number in all subsequent correspondence
        with us. Prices in US Dollars include local taxes. You agree not to hold us responsible for banking charges incurred due to payments on your account. If payment
