Sometimes all it takes to feel a little happier, or a little healthier, is getting active. Today's challenge. Be a Yes Man. Try saying yes instead of NO to things you would normally deny.No ridiculous stuff. But small things. If you do not want to call your mom for some reason. Call her. If you get asked to go to a friends house-Go. The world blossoms for us sunflowers when we step into the sun. Try it- Say yes to at least one thing out of the ordinary today and break the cycle of redundancy. You can do it!! We believe in you!</h1>
