# riseUp

This application is a forum site that allows users to seek support and advice from one another when they are faced with trials in life. 
    
For on-the-spot inspiration, the user can access random affirmations and quotes, or visit the forums to share their stories or offer advice to others. The forums will be moderated to ensure that content posted is of a supportive nature and not designed with the intent to do harm to others. Additional resources on the site include direct links to national crisis hotlines and resources to find mental health professionals or support groups in your local area. There are also a couple of fun features like our horoscope page.
